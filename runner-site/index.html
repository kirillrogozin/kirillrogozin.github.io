    <h2>Why</h2>
    <p>I love trail running because I can run everywhere: through forests, fields, hills, past lakes, rivers. Such a diversity of profiles and sights makes running an exciting exercise. It clears your mind, makes your body and life as a whole healthier and more exciting.</p>

    <h2>How exactly</h2>
    <p>Want to start running? Easy. No catch. :-) Just start running by time: say, 10, 15, 20 minutes. Increase the time gradually. Your leg muscles will start adapting to the new workload and you will feel yourself more confident while covering longer distances.</p>
        
    <h2>Equipment</h2>
    <p>I love running because you don't need to have much equipment to start the sport. All you need is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a pair of running shoes</li>
        <li>a T-shirt or a shirt</li>
        <li>shorts or tights</li>
        <li>a cap or a bandana and sunglasses</li>
        <li>a fanny bag with small water bottle holder</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you progress enough to start running for a one, two or more hours you will need a running backpack which allows you to have more equipment with you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a hydration system (a "bladder" in a backpack to have more water with you)</li>
        <li>gels to feed you with carbohydrates and give energy</li>
        <li>a flashlight to run in twilight or at night</li>
        <li>a raincoat</li>
        <li>a medical kit and rescue blanket</li>
        <li>any other stuff depending on the conditions (mountains, forests, etc)</li>
    </ul>
